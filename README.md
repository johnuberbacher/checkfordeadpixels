# checkfordeadpixels
Simple app dedicated to finding dead pixels in the easiest manner

## How it Works
Well, it's mainly handled by vanilla Javascript and some jQuery. It cheks the user input, if it's a regular keystroke it changes the background. There's a clause to reset to a white bg if you hit the ESC key or the right mouse button. Of course, hitting F11 is allowed so you may go full-screen.
